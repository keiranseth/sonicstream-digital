# SonicStream Digital Media Analysis Project

This is an end-to-end portfolio data analysis project demonstrating my proficiency in Excel, SQL, and PowerBI.

## Workplace Scenario

I am Keiran Seth, a junior data analyst in SonicStream, a digital music store platform assigned with the task of delivering a detailed analysis report covering sales performance, geographic insights, customer behavior and segmentation, and other crucial factors. I am given the [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) as a basis for my report.

See the [detailed overview](./workplace_scenario_overview/overview.md).

## Deliverables

### Statement of the Business Task

The goal of the analytics team is to deliver a comprehensive report on:

-   sales performance and operational efficiency,
-   geographic insights (with respect to sales),
-   customer behavior and segmentation,
-   employee performance,
-   and product/content strategy.

### Description of Data Sources

The analytics team will use SonicStream's in-house [database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), which contains all information in their digital media store. These include not just information about artists, albums, tracks, but also the information on invoices, customers, and employees.

See the entity-relationship diagram below.
